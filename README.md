# Stress-Level-Detection
Stress Level Detection Using Physiological Parameters


“Humidity – Temperature – Step count – Stress levels” represents the titles for Stress-Lysis.csv file. 

Based on the human’s physical activity, the stress levels of the human being are detected and analyzed here. A dataset of 2001 samples is provided for human body humidity, body temperature and the number of steps taken by the user. Three different classifications of stress are performed, low stress, normal stress, and high stress. More information on how this data is analyzed can be found at “L. Rachakonda, S. P. Mohanty, E. Kougianos, and P. Sundaravadivel, “Stress-Lysis: A DNN-Integrated Edge Device for Stress Level Detection in the IoMT,” IEEE Trans. Conum. Electron., vol. 65, no. 4, pp. 474–483, 2019.”
